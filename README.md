Hi there! 
- I'm Nafisa Ali. I currently work as an Advanced Data Science Associate in ZS Associates in Bangalore, India and also an incoming Masters student at Columbia University in the city of New York.
I have an undergrad degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering, achieving first class distinction from RV College of Engineering, Bangalore, India (Batch 2017-21).
- I'm really passionate and curious about data science, especially introducing new data science techniques in the field of healthcare analytics. In my past 2 years of expirience in ZS, I have worked
on building recommendation systems, search engines and automation tools on clinical data. I mainly focused on Natural Language Processing sub-domain and gained expertise in it, although it's an ever-emerging 
field and I try to keep myself updated with latest technologies as much as I can.
- I not only have an experience in healthcare data but also have worked in various other domains which have potential use cases for data science, such as speech processing, electronics and autonomous cars/self-driving cars.
- I am currently enthusiastic about Large Language Models, the theory behind it and it's application in healthcare firm especially.
